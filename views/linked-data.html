# Linked (Open) Data? Semantic Web?

Some sources introducing Linked Data.

## Short definitions

> Just as hyperlinks in the classic Web connect documents into a single global information space, Linked Data enables links to be set between items in different data sources and therefore connect these sources into a single global data space. The use of Web standards and a common data model make it possible to implement generic applications that operate over the complete data space. This is the essence of Linked Data.

</div>

> Linked data provides real-world things (like a bus stop or an organisation) with an address on the web (URI), and data is published about the real-world things in machine-readable formats using the URI. Other datasets can then point to those things using their URI, which means that people using the data can find out more about something without that information being copied into the original dataset (like the bus times for that stop or the spend of the organisation).

> ‘RDF 1.0’ developed by W3C is a standard model for data interchange on the Web with features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed. ‘RDF 1.1’ is an evolution of ‘RDF 1.0’ with backward compatibility, using internationalized identifiers, fine-tuning of the use of datatypes and language tags on literals, and a number of new serialization formats.
