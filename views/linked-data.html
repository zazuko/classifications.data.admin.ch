# Linked (Open) Data? Semantic Web?

Some sources to get acquainted with Linked Data.

## Short definitions

> Just as hyperlinks in the classic Web connect documents into a single global information space, Linked Data enables links to be set between items in different data sources and therefore connect these sources into a single global data space. The use of Web standards and a common data model make it possible to implement generic applications that operate over the complete data space. This is the essence of Linked Data.

</div>

> Linked data provides real-world things (like a bus stop or an organisation) with an address on the web (URI), and data is published about the real-world things in machine-readable formats using the URI. Other datasets can then point to those things using their URI, which means that people using the data can find out more about something without that information being copied into the original dataset (like the bus times for that stop or the spend of the organisation).
